    In a groundbreaking move, NITK Surathkal is leading the charge towards sustainable campus transportation through its E-Mobility initiatives. Spearheaded by Dr. Pruthviraj U and Prof. K V Gangadharan, the project aims to transform the way students and staff commute within the campus.
    The E-Mobility team at the Centre for System Design has engineered a diverse fleet of electric vehicles, including E-cycles, e-scooters, e-bikes, and specialised models for specific campus needs. AI algorithms are deployed to predict demand patterns and optimize the deployment and routing of these vehicles across the campus.

    Adding a green touch, the team has developed "URJA," a solar-based charging station. This innovative infrastructure is dynamically managed by AI, ensuring seamless charging experiences for users while considering historical data, real-time usage, and campus events.`,

    impactTitle: "Off-Road Electric Bike for Enhanced Emergency Response",
    impact: `A collaboration with the NITK Alumni Class of 1979 and SEG Automotive has led to the integration of an off-road electric bike into the SEARCH platform, significantly enhancing its reach and effectiveness.
      Designed for Rugged Terrain: This electric bike boasts exceptional off-road capabilities, making it ideal for navigating challenging environments like avalanche zones, landslide areas, and disaster-struck regions. This expands SEARCH's reach and allows for swift response in previously inaccessible areas.
      Empowering First Responders: The Impact 79_E Dirt Bike offers invaluable support to various emergency response teams, including:
          NDRF (National Disaster Response Force): Providing efficient access to disaster zones for rescue operations.
      Coastal Police, Military, and Coast Guard: Enabling efficient patrolling and operations in difficult terrains like sand and mud.
      Forest and Wildlife Authorities: Supporting anti-poaching efforts and wildlife protection activities.
      Sustainable Solution: Aligned with SEARCH's commitment to environmental responsibility, the electric bike boasts zero emissions and silent operation, minimising environmental impact during crucial operations.
      The NITK Class of 1979's financial support, SEG Automotive's technical expertise, and the collaborative efforts of CSDs at NITK Surathkal and the E MOBILITY team have resulted in a valuable addition to the SEARCH platform.
      The Impact 79 EDirt Bike embodies the spirit of continuous improvement and collaboration that drives SEARCH forward. Its integration further strengthens SEARCH's ability to respond to diverse emergencies in challenging environments, contributing to a more resilient and sustainable future.`,
